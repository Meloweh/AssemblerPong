# Assembler Pong (2018)

This project was the work of my oral exam in high school graduation.
It presented a trivial but incomplete pong game.
In the application itself, player and ball are implemented without collision indicator, the ball is
without physics and the score without function.
Thus, the ball continuously flies beyond the edge of the screen in only one direction.

Through a hook with the debugging software Cheat Engine the omitted
functionality was added to the game by assembler and made to run fully.
