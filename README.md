# Assembler Pong (2018)

This project was my work of the oral exam in high school graduation.
The idea was to show that it is possible to functionally complete a broken or incomplete game with the help of assembly hooks.
It presented a trivial but incomplete pong game.
In the application itself, the player and the ball are implemented without collision indicator and the ball is
without physics.
Thus, the ball continuously flies beyond the edge of the screen in only one direction.

Through a hook with the debugging software Cheat Engine the omitted
functionality was added to the game with assembly.
